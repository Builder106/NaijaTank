# Tailwind CSS v4 Status Check

## ✅ Already Implemented
Your project is already using Tailwind CSS v4.1.4 based on:

1. **Package.json**: `"tailwindcss": "^4.1.4"`
2. **PostCSS Config**: Using `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
3. **Styles.css**: Using v4 syntax with `@import "tailwindcss"`

## Current Implementation
- ✅ Using `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of v3 `@tailwind` directives
- ✅ Using `@theme` configuration block
- ✅ CSS variables for theme values
- ✅ Modern color system with proper naming

## What You DON'T Need to Do
- ❌ React Router v7 upgrade (you're using Angular Router)
- ❌ Most Tailwind v4 migration steps (already done)

## Potential Improvements
You could consider:
1. Adding Tailwind's Vite plugin for better performance
2. Reviewing any custom utilities for v4 compatibility
3. Ensuring all team members understand v4 syntax changes
